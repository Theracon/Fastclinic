                        At Fastclnic we believe that everyone has a right to quality healthcare. Standing as obstructions to quality healthcare delivery in Nigeria are factors such as hospital overcrowding, insufficient or ineffective facilities, and shortage of healthcare practitioners.
                        Hospital overcrowding, for one, is a major cause of reduced effectiveness and increased frustration among physicians and allied health practitioners. The consequence of work-related frustration and reduced vigor and healthcare
                        works is reduced quality of clinical services. This is a problem; so how do we solve it? Fastclinic provides a vital organ to the system of solving this problem by redirecting patient flow from overcrowded hospitals to highly functional,
                        efficient and less crowded ones closest to the patients.

                        The average patient spends substantial amount of time in the hospital waiting for services to be rendered by clinicians and other health professionals. Patient waiting time is a crucial factor in the healthcare delivery pipeline and is a major determinant
                        of healthcare quality as well as patient satisfaction. According to research, patient waiting time hovers around 2 - 3 hours on the average in the outpatient departments of (especially public) hospitals in Nigeria. That is an outrageous
                        amount of time to spend waiting for healthcare services, in any context. Fastclinic referrers effectively shorten waiting time by easing patient throughput in over-booked institutions, and transferring same to institutions that
                        have the capacity and quality to handle it.

                        waiting times and better healthcare services overall. We at Fastclinic are helping to shape the future of healthcare â€“ which we believe is largely remote.
